    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This pulled pork recipe is tender, juicy, and oh-so flavorful — and it’s incredibly easy to make in your slow cooker!</p>
    <p>This recipe calls for a pork shoulder roast for a few reasons: It’s inexpensive, forgiving to work with, and tends to have a lot of marbling (which means it’ll result in tender pulled pork).</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Oil: This pulled pork recipe starts with a teaspoon of vegetable oil at the bottom of your slow cooker.</li>
        <li>Pork: If your pork shoulder roast is larger or smaller than four pounds, you’ll need to adjust the ingredient rations and cook time.</li>
        <li>Sauces: You’ll need bottled barbecue sauce, yellow mustard, and Worcestershire sauce.</li>
        <li>Apple cider vinegar: Apple cider vinegar adds brightness and cuts through the other rich flavors.</li>
        <li>Broth: Use store-bought or homemade chicken broth.</li>
        <li>Brown sugar: Light brown sugar lends warmth and sweetness.</li>
        <li>Seasonings: This flavorful pork is seasoned with chili powder, garlic, and dried thyme.</li>
        <li>Onion: A chopped onion gives the pork tons of flavor.</li>
        <li>Buns and butter: You’ll need buttered hamburger buns if you plan to make pulled pork sandwiches.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour oil into the slow cooker, then place the roast on top of the oil. </li>
        <li>Add the remaining ingredients to the Crock-Pot. </li>
        <li>Cover and cook until the pork shreds easily. </li>
        <li>Shred the pork and return it to the slow cooker to combine it with the juices. </li>
        <li>If you’re making sandwiches, serve the pulled pork on buttered buns.</li>
    </ol>
